Starting pseudocode - Item 3
04/16/2024

Note: Here is a starting idea on how to approach Item 3 of your project. But this is by no means the complete solution or the best solution.

Step 1: 
// Use the information about the previous surgeries to estimate the number of hours required by a team
// to perform different kind of surgeries. For example, the average time predicts the amount of time
// needed to complete a surgery of certain difficulty, but other estimation procedures can be used too. 

for (each team t at hospital H) {
       for (all surgeries performed by team t in the past) 
       	compute the average time required by team t to complete a
        	surgery of difficulty c;
       
       	// alternatively, instead of the average time to complete a
       	// a certain kind of surgery, you could store the
       // distributions of the execution times, and use the 
       // distribution to predict the time of the next surgery
       
       // finally, the third alternative is to compute the averages
       // over periods of time (e.g., over one year), and then used
       // these averages to predict the time of a surgery
}

Step 2: 
// Use the information about the difficulty of previous surgeries to estimate what are the more likely 
// surgeries that might be needed while the power at the hospital is down. 

for (all surgeries s at hospital H) {
	N1 = count the number of surgeries for each difficulty type;
	N2 = count the number of surgeries per hour; 
} 

N = all surgeries that were performed at hospital H; 

for (all surgery types t) {
	estimate the number of expected surgeries of type t per hour using
	the formula N1 / N * N2; 
}
Step 3: 
// Use the predictions in steps (1) and (2) to predict the amount of energy required by each team of
// surgeons at each of the five hospitals. 

for (each surgery type t) {
	use the number of expected surgeries found in Step 2 to predict 
	how many surgeries of this kind are expected to occur during
	the estimated time the power is down; 
}

for (each team t of surgeons at hospital H) {
	use the estimates at Step 1 to find the time it takes for the 
	team to complete each surgery of type t assuming that the team
	performs all surgeries by itself;
	find the required energy assuming that the surgery equipment of
       every team utilizes the same amount of energy; 
}

Step 4: 
// Distribute the available capacity CAP of the hospital [CAP is due to the backup generators], so that a 
// hospital's teams of surgeons can achieve the most outcome for the available capacity CAP. 

while (CAP > 0) {
	for (each hour of the estimated length of the power outage) {
for (each surgery that is expected to occur, in the order of their expected number and complexity) {
			find the team x that is available and is most effective
       in handling that surgery type, such as the team that
       has required least amount of time for that type of
       surgeries;  
       
       assign team x to perform the surgery;
       
       CAP = CAP - energy expected to be used by team x;
       
       estimate the time moment when team x will finish the
       assigned surgery;
		}
       }
}
